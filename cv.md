## Me as a Person:

I have good communication skills, I personally think I'm a team player. I appreciate a cooperative atmosphere and being a quick-learner allows me to benfit from it alot. People can rely on me, because one of my main traits is self-responsibility, and I can't stand when I didn't do what I've been trusted with.
